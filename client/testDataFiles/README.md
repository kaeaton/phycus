# Data Files

These are sample files for testing and development of the clients. Most have intentionally placed errors.

A .phycus file is a CSV file with a custom header. The header must include at the minimum a population and a cohort.

For working examples of what the files should look like please see demo_OTH_test.phycus and US_CAU.phycus.
