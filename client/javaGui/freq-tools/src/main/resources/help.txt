## 2. Headers:

At the minimum there must be a population and cohort header in each file. All others are optional and will over-write options selected in the interface.

Headers must be separated by commas and spaces (outside of quotes) are not allowed.

A header example:

 > pop=OTH,cohort="Description of the cohort",license=CC0,resolution=G

[back](#top)

<a name="pop"></a>
### 2.1 Population

> pop=POPULATION_TAG

The population is a mandatory header, and to prevent duplicates, must use a population tag already found in the database. To add a population, please see the Populations tab.

<a name="cohort"></a>
### 2.2 Cohort

> cohort="Description of the cohort"

The cohort is a mandatory header. You have 255 characters available to you to describe your cohort. Do not use commas.

<a name="license"></a>
### 2.3 License

> license=CC0

The license is an optional header. If it is not provided, the license selected on the main page will be applied. If provided, the license in the header will override the option selected on the main page. There are 7 license options:

- CC0: Creative Commons no rights reserved.

### 2.4 Resolution

> resolution=gDKMS

The resolution is an optional header element describing the resolution of the allele names in the haplotypes. There are 9 resolution options (described below). If specified, the resolution must exactly match one of the following options:

- G: G-groups. HLA alleles that have identical nucleotide sequences across the exons encoding the peptide binding domains form a G group. See: [http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/g_groups.html](http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/g_groups.html)
- P: P-Groups. HLA alleles encoding the same antigen recognition domain form a P group. Null alleles are excluded from P groups. See: [http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/p_groups.html](http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/p_groups.html)
- gNMDP: "Little g group", NMDP standard. HLA alleles described at the protein level that have identical nucleotide sequences across the exons encoding the peptide binding domains form a g-group. See: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2013.06.025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2013.06.025)
- gDKMS: "Little g group", DKMS standard. HLA alleles encoding the same antigen recognition domain, including Null alleles, form a g-group. See: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2009.08.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2009.08.006)
- 1-Field: 1 field allele names. Alleles are described using only the first field of an allele name. See: [http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/naming.html](http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/naming.html)
- 2-Field: 2 field allele names. Alleles are described using only the first two fields of an allele name. 
- 3-Field: 3 field allele names. Alleles are described using only the first three fields (where possible) of an allele name. 
- 4-Field: 4 field allele names. Alleles are described using all four fields (where possible) of an allele name. 
- Serology: Serological allele names. Alleles are described using serological equivalents only. See: [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-0039.2008.01183.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-0039.2008.01183.x)
