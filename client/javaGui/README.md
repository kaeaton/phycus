To run the software:
 - mvn install
 - cd freq-tools/target
 - unzip freq-tools-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip
 - cd freq-tools-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/bin
 - open post-population-frequencies

 Please note: While the settings are in place for receipts, they are not yet implemented and are not generated. Also you will need to seed the database with at least one population or you will not be able to add additional populations via the population tab.

 This multi-modual client requires both the freq-client and freq-tools folders to work. If you wish to move it, move the entire javaGui folder or the client will not have access to the API.
